# PacMan---Factory
PacMan coding assignment
In this exercise, I learned how to manipulate my javascript files to loop arrays, incorporate parameters in my function, and using switch operators to write codes with multiple conditions.

One of the biggest challenges for me was learning how to add an event listener that would toggle and change the direction of PacMan based on the user's engagement. This was something that I've explored and wanted to incorporate as our assignment that was not yet educated to me during this module.

In the future, I would love to learn how to incorporate my assignment to feel more like the game with a vertical directional axis which would require rotating the images to change his direction up and down, adding borders that my PacMan cannot cross, and sound effects!
